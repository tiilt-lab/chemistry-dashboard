,Question,Answer
0,Real quick terms and then go into a little more depth on the the final project. Alright. So with that go ahead and Vincents line so before I even get into the sort of the of the discussion of the presentation got a handful different. Takeaways one is that broadly speaking?,"I feel like inclusion inclusivity something that's expand, the content the technology interface design practices, pedagogical strategies class, policies and more. And"
1,"Let's sort of three takeaways one is that multiple interfaces can be away for trying to promote accessibility one of the Technologies and the tools that we've been working on Multi, craft. And for that, they're trying to think about how do we make different types of technological experiences?","More accessible thinking about people and centering experiences, people. Disabilities and multiple and analytics can provide Innovative tools and techniques and Technologies to really help us study learning. And really get a sense of"
2,"It's and the right. Even still be a high schooler to mixed in there as well as some recent graduates. And then on the left hand side, our PhD students primarily, but first PCC and David David Burrell. Now working at Divas Chase Kumar, who is a postdoc working with me?","Universe has got some medicine and then Aziza is a master student, all the others are current PT students, either in computer science or"
3,"earning Sciences computer science plus learning Sciences or technology and social behavior really want to acknowledge all these people because they're the ones that really allow the lab Community to grow and to do the kind of work that I'm going to be sharing with you all today. So then kill technological innovations for inclusive, learning and teaching. And so, there's that word, that term inclusion, right?",
4,Is what does that what does that mean?,And to you know temp the the the demo Gods we're going to try to have a quick little interactive interactive thing where you guys and it's also connected to one of the platforms that my life isn't working on called blink which is a platform it's called building literacy and in-person collaboration and it's a tool that
5,"But see, I want you guys to turn this on right next to you take like, two minutes or so. And I want you guys to think about this question. What does it mean to dine inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of computer science?","Just take like two minutes and and discuss and then we will, we'll come"
6,"you, how are they learning?","And then how the experience connected to their identity, one of the ways that they're able to bring their identity to that learning space. An exercise that what I'm talking about people interfaces think about what are the tools that are available to support that learning. One of the things that make it easier for students to be able to Grapple with and learn more about different ideas and then how do those tools again, align with the Learners needs and goals and then in turn the multiple and our analytics is how much we measure learning, what are the sort of"
7,of complex ways or what are the more expansive ways we can go about?,
8,"Like to study what students are learning and then similarly, how can the analytics be relevant across?","Various tables for students, or instructors, for administrators. And really, I see all these things as connected to one another having multimodal, learning environments environments that are Hands-On involving things like discussions that might happen in classroom space. As I see it probably the Sessa Tate's, better ways to analyze better ways to be able to study those environments. They also"
9,You want that fucking building?,"It'll build that fucking for. You can use your eye gaze to navigate around the game instead of having to use the keyboard and mouse, then we've also been exploring ways to use even things like Ich eajy. So being able to study someone's brain waves as a way to sort of regulate, the type of movement that's taking place within within the game using things like gestures also. So in using leveraging immediate pipe and looking at some of their hand pose estimation or the some of the hand pose Library."
10,"Slate in front of the new game. So here, this student added to block over here. You see?","Those things show up in the time within the game environment. The two ones, there's can have another one on, but one of the things we're really thinking about is we wanted this to be an accessible experience. We also want to be clever things, things start to work differently when you have wooden blocks that multiple people can come around together and build with."
11,"Versus having an individual kid at a computer screen by themselves, right?","And so this is one of the other considerations. It's there's ways that we can start to change the experience itself, experience of playing engaging with with Minecraft by bringing in these other these other modes. There's also connections between doing this kind of work and spatial reasoning. And so that's one of the other aspects that we were looking at, with this with, this drink is, how does this type of multiple platform"
12,"And so this is one of the other considerations. It's there's ways that we can start to change the experience itself, experience of playing engaging with with Minecraft by bringing in these other these other modes. There's also connections between doing this kind of work and spatial reasoning. And so that's one of the other aspects that we were looking at, with this with, this drink is, how does this type of multiple platform?",Also be able to help us to promote space.
13,Rules and all sorts of Concepts and constructs around what Good Vibration looks like. But one thing that we're really trying to do with the blank project is going about. What does that look like from the student perspective?,How do students think about good collaboration and how do they want to be supporting thinking about collaboration
14,How do students think about good collaboration and how do they want to be supporting thinking about collaboration?,"And so that's one of the goals behind the blink which is building literacy and in person or actual enforcement operation within this work, we started to identify"
15,"My own system and it throughout the time that sort of been recording the things that I've been saying. And so you'll see that come through and then about what is this eight minutes in, we started to see the rest of the conversation. So the conversation did you guys have started to have and part of what blink wants his trying to support is ways for students to be able to go back and sort of the first ways for instructor, be able to go back and look at what's the conversations one?",
16,"All right, so let's give all that one. Um and in this specific case, you know, we're really thinking about collaboration. How do we go about studying and supporting collaboration?",And ultimately you know one thing they think about is that to study collaboration you know and some of these constructs
17,"More things coming down the line sort of increasing, increasingly adding complexity. It's also connected to us for all research, practice partnership, Grant where we are bridging between computational thinking, physical Computing in PE classes. So, we're having given, what is physical visual Computing was really thinking about about?","We're thinking about students using things like microcontrollers, to be able to engage with the world around them, but connected to"
18,"Of the starting points for our, curriculum is Spider-Man into the fibers to have students. Think about the sorts of digital sensor that they might be, that they might be using within the context of the curriculum in relationship to their own bodies to their own senses. So party, we really try to think about is what are the ways that the Shifting the content itself?","In this case, making a Content specifically hide rounds"
19,"One. And this is a student using like a left-hander that they that they that they had in their people. So content is one of the things, right?","We can shift the content as a way to promote inclusion. We can also do shift the context and so here I'm showing sort of a representation of the think about the in school versus out of school, right"
20,"We can shift the content as a way to promote inclusion. We can also do shift the context and so here I'm showing sort of a representation of the think about the in school versus out of school, right?",So you can have you can have things that you're doing within a code.
21,"See some of the technologies that are used within that space. So other ways that shifting the context and the space, where the conversation happens can be one of the other aspects. Think about inclusion, all the tools. What are the different tools?","That might be might be employed. So I put these sort of three pictures up here on the Highlight a few different contrasts. One of them is that when people encounter something like this, they're oftentimes Escape. They're all sometimes like I don't want to touch."
22,"Spirit it. So, just mentioning that to is another one of the policies as we think about inclusion, and what that means for could use our dedication, all right?","The closing down, and look at the valuation. So the ways we go about evaluating evaluates to happen. So I'm not going to go through all these things, you know"
23,"The closing down, and look at the valuation. So the ways we go about evaluating evaluates to happen. So I'm not going to go through all these things, you know?","So far in large part of what we have is, we've done surveys with several hundred people, but a few Karen interviews interviews with students a lot."
24,"Shifts are not necessarily the way we want them to go. Well, the first one is so computer. Science is boring, where we've got rad being strongly, strongly disagree, with light red Etc. The computer science is boring. You know, we see a little bit of a ship to your and students more students in disagreement with with a people. It didn't go try to do any service statistical analysis on. This is kind of let it let it be what it is. CS is fun, right?",
25,"We're getting more people at participating in a week in the programming, starting to see us computer. Science is fun start to see sort of General ships and people thinking that Sue is useful for their Community but that mean are we here?",So it's not quite as clear cut as ndscs of useful for me right
26,So it's not quite as clear cut as ndscs of useful for me right?,"You actually have more people disagree afterwards again we're working simple date. And then CSS for people like me this is what I mentioned one, right"
27,"You actually have more people disagree afterwards again we're working simple date. And then CSS for people like me this is what I mentioned one, right?",Because
28,"What ends up happening is do is go through the experience in the resultant of being a little bit. It isn't be more polarized. That you have some students gravitating toward did you haven't something's gravitating gravitating say, okay this isn't quite for me, but these are some of the ways that we're trying to go about evaluating something experience in. This is some of the shifts that we're starting to see in. Even these sort of broad, perceptions of computer science is something that is boring that or that is fun. Um, I'm going to evaluate doesn't get too close off with the what about 45?",Quotations from.
29,"An area like sports, really cool to see how our classic cell phone during this year, was to be transferable to other field trip in sports. The class, Put A New Perspective and how I can still combine my technical skills. With my personal interests for fulfilling career path, it's definitely worth exploring more after that clots. Right again, we start to see this shift in, okay?","I can actually connect computer science with my interest. I can actually connect from like all these skills that I'm learning, the things that that I'm interested in."
30,"I never thought I had much interest in this but I see it differently now and it's something that is worth taking a look at for possible future, right?",This very drastic shift was of yeah I know I know I'm just in this but now I do on his last two I was always intimidated by computer science but this class definitely helped me expand my interest in other standing up there is aspect and applications of computer science. So that shift from like I can't do this to me.
31,"Part of that is looking at we've done these surveys and part of it. We're trying to look at one of these sort of prototypical student-athlete perceptions of computer science on. If we can start to make sense around some of those things are using platforms like blink. So we can study student learning in the process. So as students are actually engaging in. These Hands-On experiences, designing different types of sports, wearables, are there different are, there different contractors measures?",We can look at Within
32,"Related to each one of those and just give back to these sort of take aways, right?","At that inclusion spans, a lot of different things. It's fans, the content and the technology expands policies that we use. Expands the ways that we go about evaluating student work, it spans the types of tools that we provide students access with as well as the context that we end up setting up for that learning to take place. And broadly speaking, that's what tilt research has really been about is trying to find"
33,What more does it use?,
34,With a team. Like what was the effect that?,"I mean, if anyone's in your question, it's I think there's there's a couple different dimensions and different aspects of what you ask. One of them is showing them a picture of someone who maybe they look up to, or is sort of like a role model kind of thing, but without the personal connection,"
35,"So that I think is one thing, right?","I think part of what we are really trying to do is push connection, books connection to local people who you can actually engage and interact with and that that seem accessible that seem like, you know, it's one thing to, you know, to see someone"
36,Famous doing something but it's different when it's someone within your own local space. I think there is there. Is that that distinction?,"Um, I know, I guess, I think that actual interactions with technology"
37,"Or oftentimes going to have much more longing, long long, lasting impacts than a simple image, right?","A picture here shows somebody something is different than when they interact with in and actually start to experience some level of Joy, some level of satisfaction"
38,"And it, it also sets of space for them to like feel that agency of I accomplish this thing. I built that thing versus oh, right?","Yeah, I use the same Microsoft Surface that such and such James Harden."
39,"Yeah, I'm back to the original question. How do you design for inclusion?","And I didn't dream of the challenges is that almost everything you pick tends to be a mix of included and excluded satellite radio, communicated more immediate do photography like that. On the other hand, the introverts tend to be left out a lot of mouths. Dominates the conversation, where is if there's some more or less, all right down."
40,"You know, speech based input requires that someone speak into the system, right?","And that's why I try to think about, okay, you guys speak base input, you've got tangibles, you've got eye gaze, you've got still text-based. If you want to be able to type it in and we actually found a lot of people still really like to just go text-based but yeah, I think I think part of it. Is this something I talk about in."
41,Some of the coolest of making says building stuff. Is we also want to start to be clear about our assumptions?,"Like what are our expectations, our assumptions about who the users are and be able to to at least be honest about that. Kind of say, look, I'm assuming that this device is made for someone who has very high pot of fine motor control with both hands. Someone who is fully sighted, that kind of thing."
42,"Because it is a challenge, right?",It is a challenge that within some interfaces you definitely. You don't definitely end up. Excluding people.
43,He stuffed and so is there are there like you seen any good predictors for?,"So you know, in thinking about inclusion some of and we haven't used these within this part within is this work, both some of the stuff we use is also like in packaging for"
44,"When you're doing something that is very heavily tied to some of Interest, they can get really really invested, right?","That that if you're doing something for an axial, that give you a very clear example of it, we understood didn't who was really into Minecraft and really into computer programming when we design the program, they're not learning experience, that was action to combine computer science and Minecraft. They tanked like it did not go well for them at all and it was extremely frustrating."
45,"You know, being able to take into account. What are the actual?","Felt physiological responses that students are having with in those kinds of settings. But definitely make sense, and not somewhere. We want to be able to go with in here for of this work is from that different multiple data that students are already collecting and using in conjunction with the sports wearables, that they might be creating. How do we go about then"
46,"Felt physiological responses that students are having with in those kinds of settings. But definitely make sense, and not somewhere. We want to be able to go with in here for of this work is from that different multiple data that students are already collecting and using in conjunction with the sports wearables, that they might be creating. How do we go about then?",Developing these models of what
47,Developing these models of what?,"Feeling inclusion, feel included."
48,"Looks like what you know, learning looks like, what deep engagement looks like, what?",
49,Imp Attica?,Yeah. So it's an important out of MIT is a yeah roslin's lab which is now discontinued. Like the Acoustics are was what like 10 years ago or something like this.
50,"To help students. Preserve some level of privacy and not try to Peg individual utterances to a certain person. A lot of we want to look at is, what is the group level interaction?","What is, how does the distribution of conversation within this group look as opposed to, you know, Marcelo"
51,Parents because that's when we do things right?,"Yeah. They can buy them, the kids by themselves playing Minecraft and like a joke. I don't know how to use this game Ryan, just physically, physically, come in, use those blocks together. That's really"
52,"It was 250 maybe 50 students, really?","Yeah that that's like a unprecedented feel like I mean I was reaching in the capital like hundred but then the only offering of 330 that year, all right"
53,"Yeah that that's like a unprecedented feel like I mean I was reaching in the capital like hundred but then the only offering of 330 that year, all right?",
54,"But see, I want you guys to turn the someone next to you take like, two minutes or so. And I want you guys to think about this question. What does it mean to design an inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of computer science?",Just take like two minutes and and discussion and we will will come back to you.
55,"No, or might not identify with especially, you have to hear from them and take it. Take their needs and feedback at Tokyo. You can't dislike and prescribe something. Yeah, I was thinking something along the same lines as like it very much matters. Okay, well, who am I designed this apartment for and then what are the goals?","Like my goals may be as a designer, their goals that"
56,"If you want to design for that group, that you have to talk to that girl, right?","And their instructors and the volunteers. And one thing that makes me think of is that I feel like any computer science space has to be flexible. Okay. Lover, you know, it's hard to be like, okay, I have to have like a specific curriculum or a syllabus or whatnot, but I almost feel like I'm really"
57,"Sign or sort of inclusive learning experiences computer has who's winning percentage, beautifying environments, and broadly. Speaking, I think about that as integrating multimodal learning multiple interfaces and multimodal analytics, and to give you some more details around that, what are they going to multiple learning?","I'm really thinking about what is the constant, that's been some money"
58,"I'm really thinking about what is the constant, that's been some money?",How are they learning
59,How are they learning?,"And then, how is the experience connected to their identities"
60,"And then, how is the experience connected to their identities?",One of the ways it is able to bring their eye.
61,"Energy to that morning, spacing exercise. That is what I've done, multiple interfaces, anyone?",What are the tools that are available to support that one
62,What are the tools that are available to support that one?,"One of the things that make it easier for students to be able to Grapple with and learn about different ideas. And how do those tools again, aligning with the Learners needs and goals and then in turn, the multiple FL analytics, is how much we measure work, what are the sort of complex ways or"
63,"Things start to work differently. When you have wooden blocks that multiple people can come around together and build with versus having an individual kids at a computer screen by himself, right?",And so this is one of the other considerations. It's there's ways that we can start to change the experience itself experience of climbing engaging with with Minecraft by agreeing energies other these other modes. There's also connections between doing this kind of work and spatial reasoning and so that's one of the other half.
64,"Aspects that we were looking at with this with this ring is, how does this type of multiple platforms?","Also be able to help us to promote visual reasoning and computational thinking this is one of the examples of one of the prototypes that we've been working on introduction with with multitasking. The other thing we also think about is, you know, I mentioned that we can use eye gaze as a way for people to control the actual Minecraft in the mulch."
65,So part of the blink project is really around this question of what this would clobber a Sheen. Look like now researchers have come up with all sorts of conceptual models and all sorts of Concepts and constructs around what good collaboration looks like. But one thing that we're really trying to do with the link project is think about. What does that look like from the student perspective?,How do students think about good collaboration and how do they want to be supported think among tribes
66,How do students think about good collaboration and how do they want to be supported think among tribes?,
67,"Would be able to see. But there's also this graphic. I'm just going to cover the direction for now. So I started some of the very beginning of the talk on my own on my own system, and it's throughout the time that sort of been recording the things that I've been saying it will see that come through. And then about what is this 9:52?",We start to see the rest of the conversation. So the conversation that you guys had started to have
68,"And individual pod and start to look at. All right, there is the living room. You can start to look at individual pod and within this part, there's a way to set up different keywords that you might want to pay attention to which I didn't set up key word for this. But we also do some sentiment analysis and so over the course of the conversation, be able to see things. This is based on figures accommodations gain speed Breakers. What was your card counting the harbor to inquire?",
69,"Further studies are understanding the morning but also be able to support their own learning within majority of cases where people are doing more discussion based activities. All right. So you on that one um and in this specific case, you know, we're really thinking about collaboration. How do we go about studying in supporting collaboration?","And ultimately, you know, one thing to think about is that specific libraries is some of these Concepts probably does require some"
70,"Trying to destroy this, we can study around multimodal learning designer, multiple Technologies. What is it has a multiple Technologies and offer a generous space for people to engage in learning the sports?",And project is thing that previously called the emotion
71,And project is thing that previously called the emotion?,Is it Snowden on our website
72,Is it Snowden on our website?,"Felt that no further use Flash project / support, someone is actually between Denton Sports and but I think this is important - and it's connected to to intercept project so one is connected to intercept."
73,"Having a cigarette, just what is physical Computing?","Physical Community was really thinking about, but we're thinking about students using things like microcontrollers to be able to engage with the world around them, but connected to computers. So, they're doing things with various sensors, a lot of what you're going to see is students using the accelerometer data. For example, to be able to study"
74,"Might be that you might be using within the context of the curriculum in relationship to their own bonds to their own senses. So part of, we really, I think about is what are the ways that the Shifting the content itself?","And in this case making the content specifically tied on Sports, can start to draw people in and start drilling crew including one. Giving me things that we start to see to in terms of content is students, get excited when they think they're doing something. That's fact that they're"
75,"We can also do shift the context and so here I'm showing sort of representation of the thing about the in school versus out of school, right?","So you can have you can have things that you're doing within a coding class, which you also have things that take place outside. But then also shifting it from something that is"
76,"Where we've got red being strongly strongly disagree, like bread Etc, on the computer science is boring. You know, we see a little bit of a shift here and students more students than a disagreement with a people. Wouldn't go try to do any service statistical analysis on this. It's not let it let it be what it is. Siesta fun, right?",We're getting more.
77,"People are participating, weakness. Programming starting to see his computer science is fun. Start to see is our general ships and people thinking as to its usual for their Community for down here, we're here. So it's not quite as clear cut as idea. CSU for for me, right?","You actually have more people disagreeing afterwards. Again, we're looking at a hate mncs for people like this one. Interesting one. Right, because what ends up happening, is students go through experience as a result in the thing. A little bit. It is more polarized."
78,"Classic suffering. There is fear was to be transferable to the field trip in sports and possibly New Perspective and how I can still combine with technical skills with my personal interest for prevailing professional, it's definitely worth exploring more after that class. Right, again, we start to see this shift in, okay?","I can actually connect computer science with my interest, all right"
79,"I can actually connect computer science with my interest, all right?",Actually connect things like all these skills and learning the things that that I'm interested in.
80,"In this but I see it differently now and it's something that is worth taking a look at for possible future, right?","This very drastic shift was of yeah, no, I know understand this, but now I do audio last two, I was always intimidated by computer science, but this definitely helps me expand my interest in understanding the various aspects and application of computer science. So that ship from like I can't do this to me. Okay. This this might be something like it, I could be involved. I thought you were"
81,"Right length. So we can study student learning in the process as context. Engaging, these Hands-On experiences, designing different types of sports, wearables, are there different?",Are there different countries that matters if you look.
82,"My next to you take like, 2 minutes or so and I want you guys to think about this question, what does it mean to design inclusive?","Learning environments, particularly in the context of computer science take like two minutes and discuss and then we will suppose we'll come back to bed."
83,"Oh, do we have to click the mic to get it to start?","No, no."
84,"How do you think begin, understanding cotton designs in order to get people that you?",
85,"Or might not identify with especially, you have to hear from them and take it, take me to eat that. You can't stuff like, and prescribe something. Yeah, I was thinking something along the same lines of like it very much matters. Okay. Well, who am I designed this environment for and then what are the goals?",Like my goals may be as a designer their goals as
86,Why?,Nobody's left out whatever.
87,Changed. So what do you think in a CS glass?,"Yeah, tickly relevant factors."
88,"Peter and broadly speaking, I think about that, as integrating multiple learning, multiple interfaces and multiple analytics and to give you some more details around that, what are they going?",Multiple learning and really thinking about what is the content that's been
89,Multiple learning and really thinking about what is the content that's been?,How are they learning
90,How are they learning?,"And there's, how is the experience connected to their identity"
91,"And there's, how is the experience connected to their identity?",What are the way that they want to bring their identity to that learning space exercises
92,What are the way that they want to bring their identity to that learning space exercises?,
93,How do they want to be supported?,And so that's one of the goals behind the school.
94,"A lot of we want to look at what is, how does the distribution of as opposed to Marcel assistance?","So that is that is someone intentional, it did show."
95,What you guys did to you?,Thanks.
96,So what do you think she has class?,
97,"And to give you some more details around that, whatever you are multiple learning. And really thinking about, what is the content that students are learning, how are they learning?","And then probably experienced connected to their identities. One of the ways that they're able to bring their identities to that learning space in exercises when I'm talking about mobile interfaces. And you know, one of the tools that are available to support that money, what are the things that make it easier for students to be able to Grapple with and learn about different views"
98,"And then probably experienced connected to their identities. One of the ways that they're able to bring their identities to that learning space in exercises when I'm talking about mobile interfaces. And you know, one of the tools that are available to support that money, what are the things that make it easier for students to be able to Grapple with and learn about different views?",And then how do those tools to get aligned
99,And then how do those tools to get aligned?,
100,My we measured learning what are the sort of complex ways or what are the more expensive ways we can go about trying to study?,"What students are learning and then similarly, how can the end links to relevant across very stable for students or instructors, who are administrators and really I see all these things as connected to on them, having multimodal learning environments environments that are Hands-On involving things like discussions, that might happen."
101,Gold structure and it'll build that structure for you. We have capabilities that also had an eye tracking. So you can actually specify with your eye gaze where it is. You want that truck to be built?,"Oh, that truck before you can use your eye gaze to navigate around the game. Instead of people, then we've also been exploring ways to use, even things like EG EG. So being able to study someone's brain waves as a way to sort of regulate the type of movement that's taking place within within"
102,"Accessible experience. We also want to be collaborative things. Things start to work differently. When you have wooden blocks that multiple people can come around together and build with versus having an individual kid at a computer screen by themselves, right?",And so this is one of the other considerations is its there's ways that we can start to change the experience itself. Experience of playing the vision was with Minecraft by bringing in these other these other modes there's also
103,"Choose between doing this kind of work and spatial reasoning. And so that's one of the other aspects of what we were looking at with this, with this great. That's how does this type of multiple platforms?","Also be able to help us to promote spatial reasoning and computational thinking. This is one of the examples of one of the prototypes that we've been working on in conjunction with with multipath. The other thing that we also think about is, you know, I mentioned that we can use eye gaze as a way."
104,It's of conceptual models and all sorts of Concepts and constructs around what good coverage look like. But one thing that we really fit in with the link project is think about. What does that look like in the student perspective?,How do you
105,How do you?,
106,You think about good collaboration and how do they want to be supported thinking of coverage?,"And so that's one of the goals behind this link which is building literacy in person or actually in person. Some reason within this work we started to identify different constructs and this is from surveys of how students are thinking about collaboration and we'll go through all of these. But we're really trying to ground the ideas of the information that we provide to students through blank and you know, ideally this is a platform that we've used in a sort of college."
107,"Customize, what other kinds of things you might want to be paying attention to in the conversation?",
108,"All right, so people that was um and in this specific case, you know, we're really thinking about collaboration. How do we go about studying and supporting collaboration?",And ultimately you know one thing to think about is that to study fibers in some of these constructs
109,"For example, to be able to study today, we're in year 3 of this, we did some work with teachers. Did the pilot testing this year?",Every fifth grade student and District 65 should be using our curriculum as starting march to sort of start to explore some opportunities and connection between p and Q. And then no-cost extension. You
110,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like what counts is computer science?",Yeah.
111,Did you continue doing?,Have you published that
112,Have you published that?,
113,"And broadly speaking. I think about that as integrating multiple learning, multiple interfaces and multimodal analytics and give you some more details around that. When are they going home with learning really thinking about?",What is the content that's going to work
114,What is the content that's going to work?,How are they learning
115,How are they learning?,And then how the experience connected to their identities
116,And then how the experience connected to their identities?,One of the ways they do to bring their identity to that mountain face mask. Because one of our multiple interfaces
117,They are one of the tools that are available to support that one. What are the things that make it easier for students to be able to Grapple with how do those tools begin align with the. And then in terms of multiple Excel analytics is how my we measure learning. What are the sort of complex ways or what are the more expansive ways you can go about trying to study?,
118,"More. Well, I love you to be able to participate within a game. I've been some of the learning space that Ben has seen through position abilities, really?",
119,"And wooden blocks and those ends in translating from of indicates. So here's the data to block over here. You see those things open real time within the game environment. The two months there, you have another one on, but one of the things we're going to be talking about is we want us to be accessible experience?",We also want to be proper things to work differently when you have wooden blocks.
120,"And people can come around together and build with or just having the individual kids at a computer screen by themselves. Right is no, this is one of the other consideration is there's ways and we can start to change the experience itself, experience of playing and giggling with Minecraft by bringing in these other. These other modes there's also connection between doing this kind of work and spatial reasoning and so that's one of the other aspects, the world you are looking at with this with this great, how does the test multiple platforms?",
121,"Looking at different visual relationships, different spatial components that they're interacting with within the game. So in this one is to do, can't ask where it has to do with recreate this structure, that's providing this picture on, but acting the game environment and study what are the visual cues that they're paying attention to partially with the hypothesis?",That some of the spatial reasoning tractors is that students like use on the traditional development or revision test
122,That some of the spatial reasoning tractors is that students like use on the traditional development or revision test?,They're also employing here but some of our work tuition
123,"The Grafton for now. So I started is done with a very beginning of the talk, on my own, my own system. And throughout the time instead of been reporting the things that I've been saying and then about, what is this statement?",Then infect the rest of the conversation. So the conversation that you guys started to have and prime plus link once and trying to support is
124,"Take like 2 minutes or so and I want you guys to think about this question, what does it mean to design an inclusive learning environment, particularly in content?",
125,About a but this is kind of new territory for me. So that's just my current view this. I think I think I think I can agree with that. Yeah I think I think basically I guess I think it's kind of interesting question. I think there's lots of different ways you can. Ya come at this?,I see
126,"If you think about the environment, I try initially to make it as accessible as possible, right?","Right. Then doesn't guarantee that. It's going to be inclusive, but I think you have"
127,"Yeah, he stuck to his labs. Are you, are you?",So are you related
128,So are you related?,Or are you have you done
129,Or are you have you done?,More solo
130,More solo?,Are you all right
131,Are you all right?,
132,What are some of the ways that I'm thinking about how to design for inclusive?,
133,"Broadly speaking, I think about that as integrating multimodal learning, multiple databases and multimodal analytics and to give you some more details around that whether they are multiple morning and really thinking about what is the content that's being. So, how were they learning?",And then how is the experience connecting to the right
134,And then how is the experience connecting to the right?,
135,"As accessible as possible, right?","Right. This doesn't guarantee that it's going to be inclusive, but I think you have at least probably eliminate some barriers. Yeah. Potential friction. Yeah. Have a chance to break. Be more inclusive. Yeah. So an example, I'm kind of in this is kind of, I mean, maybe this happens more often than I think, but, you know, an example, I'm kind of in my mind is like, you know,"
136,"And some of his stomach to its lab is don't love Tire. Like, how are you?",Are you
137,Are you?,So are you related or in our history
138,So are you related or in our history?,We have you done work more so are you. All right
139,We have you done work more so are you. All right?,Really. Thank you guys.
140,"But yeah, I want you guys to turn to someone next to you take, like, 2 minutes or so. And I want you guys to think about this question, what does it mean to design an inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of computer science?",Just take like two minutes and and discuss
141,"Hi, I have no idea. It should know. What do you think?",
142,"Think about that as integrating multimodal learning, multiple interfaces, and multimodal analytics and to give you some more details around that. But I think about multiple learning and really thinking about what is the content that students about how were they learning?","And then how the experience connected to their identity, one of the ways it is able to bring their identity to that learning space. An exercise that I do multiple interfaces. They know what are the tools that are available to support that money. One of the things that"
143,"For you by themselves, right?","And so this is one of the other consideration and it's there's ways that we can start to change the experience itself, experience of playing the game Minecraft by bringing in these other other folks. There's also connections between doing this kind of work and spatial reasoning. And so that's one of the other aspects that we were looking at with this, which is great. How does this affect multiple platforms"
144,"And so this is one of the other consideration and it's there's ways that we can start to change the experience itself, experience of playing the game Minecraft by bringing in these other other folks. There's also connections between doing this kind of work and spatial reasoning. And so that's one of the other aspects that we were looking at with this, which is great. How does this affect multiple platforms?",Also be able to help us to promote visual reasoning and something.
145,"Tracking within the game. So in this sort of specific kind of task or it has to do, is recreate this structure. That's providing this picture but actually in the game environment and study, what are the visual cues that they're paying attention field partially with the hypothesis?",That some of the spatial reasoning practices that students might use on a traditional multiple liberalization test. Their also employment here but some of our work to is showing us that students are doing Innovative and novel things in this kind of game environment.
146,And all sorts of Concepts and constructs around what?,"Good fiber. He looks like. But one thing that we're really going to do with the link project this week about, what does that look like"
147,"Good fiber. He looks like. But one thing that we're really going to do with the link project this week about, what does that look like?",From the student perspective
148,From the student perspective?,"How do students think about good collaboration and how do they want to be supportive things, most funders"
149,"How do students think about good collaboration and how do they want to be supportive things, most funders?",And so that's one of the goals behind this link which is building literacy in person or actual enforcement operations within this work. We started for the
150,"Talk on my own, my own system and it dropped the time and sort of been recording the things that I've been saying to. And you'll see that come through and then about what is the statement?","It's in, we start to see the rest of the conversation. So the conversation that you guys have started to have and part of what blink wants his trying to support is ways for students to be able to go back and sort of the first winter instructor field."
151,And it's the sort of thing that can be customized. What?,Other kinds of things you might want to be paying attention to
152,"All right, so let's see what that one. And then this specific case, you know, we're really thinking about collaboration. How do we go about studying and supporting collaboration?","And ultimately, you know, one thing to think about is that to study properties in some of these Concepts,"
153,"In front of predictions around their own behavior and all show a couple of examples of that with more things coming down the line. So increasing increasing the added complexity. It's also connected to see, s4l research, practice partnership, grants, where we are bridging between competition thinking, physical Computing in PE classes. So we're having a gun. What is physical Computing?","Physical Computing was really thinking about all the, we're thinking about students using things like microcontrollers"
154,"That is exactly 5 should be using our curriculum. As starting March 24, start to explore some opportunities and few between TV and you didn't and then no-cost extension year, which will likely ask for. We're actually planning on trying to Branch into the in the CPS in the Chicago public schools and see how some of the researchers and developers can work in there. So what are the motivation for this?",
155,"And then the other big part of it is, you know, students are ultimately trying to design new sports technology. So here you're seeing this drawings of one and this is a student using like a little less counter this case that they had in their. So prompt is one of these, right?",We can shift the contents as a way to move. We can also do shift the context and so here I'm showing sort of a representation
156,"station of the thinking about the in school versus out of school, right?","So you can have, you can have things that you're doing within a coding class. But you also have things that take place out of school, but then also shifting it from something that is sort of Education, Focus. So to speak that you're in the bottom of the sort of Afterschool programming coding classes."
157,"The wearables looks different here than when you're in a traditional classroom space. And then we also took a group of about 40 students to Chicago Bears for anything, even see some of the technologies that are used within that space. So other way is that shifting the context and the space, where the conversation happens?","We won the other aspects thing but inclusion the tools. One of the different tools that might be, might be important. So I put these sort of three pictures up here."
158,"But down here. We see as though it's not quite as clear, cut as idea, CSU useful for me, right?","You actually have more people disagreeing afterwards. Again we're looking at a debate and then CSS. For people like me, this is one of the interesting one, right"
159,"You actually have more people disagreeing afterwards. Again we're looking at a debate and then CSS. For people like me, this is one of the interesting one, right?","Because what ends up happening is students will be experienced in the result in this being a little bit, isn't be more polar that you have some students replicating board to get some dudes. Gravitating"
160,"Oops. It's definitely worth exploring more after that class. Right again, we start to see this shift in, okay?",I can actually connect computer science with my interest. I can actually connecting like all these skills and learning the things that that I'm interested in.
161,"I never thought I had much interest in this but I see it differently now and it's something that is worth taking a look at for possible future, right?","This very drastic shift was of. Yeah, no. I"
162,"Prepare a simple wearable for helping people track their head position for this playing basketball, right?","So, how much time are they spending with their head looking down versus actually looking around the basketball court, which is, you know, Common challenge across different, she supports these similar examples of people trying to practice starting in sports, like, track and field. Instead of trying to have somebody come out with is on your mark, get set. Go, if you go program, a microcontroller to randomly generate starting,"
163,So I don't question. What about evaluate X?,"You see in inclusive Technologies. So for instance, the sport sense, if you give like no, like an image or video of like their favorite athlete using Technologies and professional sport. You see, at all the time where people are using"
164,"Surfaces or whatever technology is, you just give them some context that someone their heroes or someone of their same color is using Technologies. The effect, the effect of that compared to inclusive technology?","Seeing sort of that can, you know, or what more does inclusive exclusivity or technology that uses a with a table. Like what is this"
165,"Seeing sort of that can, you know, or what more does inclusive exclusivity or technology that uses a with a table. Like what is this?",
166,"That I think it's one thing, right?","I think part of what we're really trying to do is push connection, folks connection to multiple people who actually engage and interact with. And that that seemed excessive that seem like, you know, it's one thing to, you know, to see someone famous doing something."
167,"But it's different when it's someone within your own local sticks. But I think there is there, is that distinction?","I know, I guess, I think that actual interaction with technology"
168,"are oftentimes going to have much more long, and long on lasting impacts than simple image, right?","Picture show. Somebody something different than when they interact within an action. Start to experience some level of Joy, some level of"
169,"I didn't dream of the challenges is that almost everything you pick tends to be a mix of include and exclude. So I with audio you mean it makes it more media, people can talk and things like that. On the other hand, the introverts tend to be left out loud mouth dominates the conversation. Where is it?","There's some more, let's all write down some notes kind of thing. More people, get different just and so you can't do one or the other, but it's awesome. Every time you add something it almost like yeah, I gotta put these people."
170,"Just excluded some others. And so the design issue becomes how to when things reasonably without becoming overwhelming in the complexity of the environment you're in. And that's, I think that's one of the things that we came across with multi, perhaps because, you know, speech face input, required attendance peek into the system, right?","And that's why we try to think about, okay"
171,"And that's why we try to think about, okay?",
172,"You've got speed phase, input tangibles, the Tigers, you got still text-based, if you want to be able to type it in and we actually found a lot of people still really like to just go text-based but yeah I think I think part of it is this something I talk about in some of the makings of building stuff is we also want to start to be clear about our assumptions?",
173,"Good burn design next, you take like two minutes ago and I want you guys to think about this question. What does it mean to design inclusive learning environment, particularly in the context of computer science take like two minutes and discuss and then we will will come together. Okay, what do you teach?","Okay, how does, how do you see ya"
174,"Okay, how does, how do you see ya?",
175,The issue when you've been teaching. So I often have students of God go through a new. Yeah. Isn't that correct?,Your time from time to time
176,Your time from time to time?,There are challenges. So I try to deal with that sometimes. But I think vision
177,"challenges are going to be something that I don't know how to write most of the time. What I do is I saw them code, I write the code with right missing most of them. Has anyone done any research like and serious programming language designed that to not check space like that?",He's a little more.
178,"Create supplement of in which we communicate through a picture, right?","So you're saying like even at a deeper level, you're relying on mental imagery, sort of like mental sort of like Vision schema. And if you don't have a visual reference like it's really it's a much harder to sort of. Yeah exactly. So first things yesterday I sold them Mexican. Spoken lexical scoping is a textual perfect about that sweetheart."
