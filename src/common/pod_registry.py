"""Cross-process registry of pods currently being post-hoc processed.

Four posthoc claim flows (audio full-analytics / P&I / E&T, and video) each
hand-rolled the same thing: a threading.Lock, a module-level dict, an
"if key in dict: reject; dict[key]='running'" claim, and scattered
dict.pop(...) releases — plus, after fix #6, a parallel DistributedClaim call
next to each. That is duplicated coordination boilerplate.

PodRegistry is that pattern, once. It fuses the DistributedClaim (at most one
holder across processes, TTL self-heal) with the local dict that holds the live
processing object (a live object can't cross processes, so it stays local for
teardown). It is a drop-in for the old dict where the processors touch it
(pop/get/keys/__contains__/[]=), but the claim DECISION is the explicit atomic
``try_claim`` — a plain ``[]=`` can't express "reject if already running".
