"""Interruption handling for live attribution.

Tier 1 — split at the speaker change: most classroom "interruption" is rapid
alternation, not sustained double-talk. A short embedding window slides
across the segment; when the best-matching participant flips and stays
flipped, the segment is split at the nearest word boundary and each part is
attributed independently — two clean rows instead of one smeared abstain.

Tier 2 — name the overlap: when two participants BOTH score strongly across
the same span (true simultaneous speech), the span is marked contested with
both names instead of silently abstaining. For collaboration analytics an
overlap is signal, not noise.

Pure logic; depends only on pyDiarization's print scoring so it can be tested
offline against retained recordings.
