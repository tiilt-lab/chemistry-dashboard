# <HOSTNAME>: Your host computer's hostname (as found by typing 'hostname', include any domain that is printed by hostname).
#   static-ip: A static IP address to pick. For Middleton, this should be between 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.20; make sure there isn't any conflicts.
#   bridge-network: This is the EXACT text of the network adapter you choose when loading vagrant. (e.g. "en2", "en1: WiFi Airport")
