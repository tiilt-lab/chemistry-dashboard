## Available Scripts to run server

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
