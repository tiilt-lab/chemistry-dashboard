129,Joe Hummel,0:29:18,"I think about what are the ways that shifting the content itself, in this case, making the content delivery tied around Sports, can start to draw people in and start to really promote inclusion. One of the other neat thing that we started to see to. In terms of content is students get excited when they think they're doing something. That's fact that you're like you and something countercultural that they're doing things, something to disrupt what was intended or when they are uncovering some sort of",,,,13,1,2,5,7,-1,87
129,Joe Hummel,0:29:48, Secret. And so one of the other components that we do within this curriculum is we will actually like have students take one of these these Technologies apart and start to see the inner workings of those Technologies or find ways to trick those Technologies. And in the process of trying to trick those technologies that really have to start to think about what are the sort of the models that we use and then start to sort of putting the play because I've got some groans mom.,,,,18,1,0,9,1,-1,88
129,Joe Hummel,0:30:13,"And then the other big part of it is, you know, students are ultimately trying to design new sports technology. So here you're seeing this drawings of one and this is a student using like a little less counter this case that they had in their. So prompt is one of these, right? We can shift the contents as a way to move. We can also do shift the context and so here I'm showing sort of a representation",,,,10,1,2,11,5,-1,79
