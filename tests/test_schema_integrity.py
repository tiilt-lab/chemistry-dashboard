"""Schema referential-integrity contracts (architecture fix #5).

Integrity was enforced by application code that every delete path had to
remember (and forgot — orphan rater/rating/survey rows, and the delete_user FK
crash). The database should enforce it. These are source-level contracts (the
models can't be imported under CI, which has no Flask): they assert the FK +
ON DELETE CASCADE declarations are present so a careless edit can't quietly
drop them. The actual cascade is verified against the live DB at migration time.
