"""The per-window video-metric reducer shared by utility.py.

utility.py had two byte-near-identical copies of this reduce (the CSV export
path batch_video_metrics, and the synthesis path
aggregate_video_metric_per_window). They had DRIFTED on the empty-window
fallback: the CSV copy emitted avg_attention=None, the synthesis copy emitted
avg_attention=0 for the IDENTICAL no-data window. Unified here on None ("no
attention data"), which is what the CSV already did and is only carried (never
arithmetic'd) downstream in synthesis.

Lives in its own import-light module so CI can test it (utility.py imports
Flask/SQLAlchemy).
